# DreamSoccerTeam-API

I present my own API with backend and simple frontend to communicate with an API.

An API allows to build a soccer team and store a basic information about players (name, team, position, market value).

An app consists of two servers (operating simultaneously):

- port 3000, app backend -> makes API requests,
- port 4000, API backend -> my API responds.

There is no connection to the real database, data are stored in an array (in memory data store).

A REST API approach:

- use CRUD operations to perform the most common tasks of data management,
- generate JSON output,
- use status code in error handling.

## Overview

### How to start

Running on localhost:

- use e.g. Visual Studio Code,
- run command to install dependencies -> npm i,
- run command to install nodemon globally on the PC -> npm i -g nodemon,
- run command -> nodemon index.js,
- open separate terminal and run command -> nodemon server.js,
- website is running on localhost, so open a web browser and run http://localhost:3000/

or use Postman for API testing:

- use e.g. Visual Studio Code,
- run command to install dependencies -> npm i,
- run command to install nodemon globally on the PC -> npm i -g nodemon,
- run command -> nodemon index.js,

- sign up for a Postman Account,
- select "HTTP Request" to create a new request,
- enter request methods, parameters and url with proper endpoint.
